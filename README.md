# Distributed Matrix Multiplication using MPI in Python

This project demonstrates distributed matrix multiplication using the [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/) (Message Passing Interface) model with Python. It compares serial and parallel implementations, analyzes performance metrics, and visualizes speedup and efficiency across different process counts.Currently the program works for matrix size like 1024, 2048,4096. The assumption is that the size of matrix should be divisible by the no of processes. Change the path in each of the py file, input file and the sh file to the path where the program is execcuted accordingly

## ðŸš€ Objective

- Implement matrix multiplication using both serial and MPI-based parallel methods.
- Evaluate and visualize performance across different matrix sizes and process counts.
- Benchmark and analyze scalability, speedup, and efficiency.
